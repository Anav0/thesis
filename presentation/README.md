I gave my PhD thesis presentation on October 22nd, 2020. It was
recorded, and you can see that recording on YouTube here:

It was immediately followed by my thesis defense, which I passed subject
to the typical bits and pieces of revisions the committee wanted to see.

The person who introduces me in the video is Robert Morris, my thesis
advisor. The Q&A has been cut out, as I want to edit it a bit and mix in
questions from the public presentation I gave on YouTube the day before.
I will link the Q&A video here once it is out. You can find the slides
in [slides.pdf](./slides.pdf) and a transcript of the video in
[transcript.txt](./transcript.txt). The thesis itself is not yet
published, but I will link the final PDF here once it is.
