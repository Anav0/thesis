  ABSTRACT
  \vspace{\baselineskip}

  Existing dataflow systems must either materialize no state, or materialize
  all state. The former precludes interesting applications, and the latter
  incurs onerous memory overhead and prevents fast changes to the dataflow.
  This thesis proposes partially stateful dataflow, where only the working set
  of the application is materialized, and other data is fetch and computed
  only on demand.
