  ABSTRACT
  \vspace{0.5\baselineskip}

  This thesis proposes a practical database system that lowers latency and
    increases supported load for read-heavy applications. Where traditional
    databases repeatedly re-execute queries, the presented system uses
    incrementally-maintained materialized views to cache query results. As
    opposed to state-of-the-art systems, the presented system builds the cache
    on demand, and evicts cache entries in response to a shifting workload.

  \vspace{0.5\baselineskip}

  The enabling technique that the thesis introduces is \textit{partially
    stateful materialization}, which allows entries in materialized views to be
    \textit{missing}. The thesis introduces \textit{upqueries} as a mechanism to
    fill such missing state on demand in Noria, a materialized view system built
    using dataflow.

  \vspace{0.5\baselineskip}

  Experimental results suggest that the presented system increases supported
    application load by up to $20\times$ over MySQL, and reduces memory use by
    up to $\sfrac{2}{3}$ compared to existing approaches.
