  ABSTRACT
  \vspace{0.5\baselineskip}

  This thesis proposes a practical database system that lowers latency and
    increases supported load for read-heavy applications. Where traditional
    databases re-execute queries each time, the presented system maintains a
    cache of past query results, and uses it to serve queries efficiently. As
    opposed to state-of-the-art systems, the presented system builds the cache
    on demand, and evicts cache entries in response to a shifting workload.

  \vspace{0.5\baselineskip}

  The thesis proposes \textit{partially stateful materialization}, which adds
    eviction and on-demand recomputation to materialized database views. The
    thesis introduces \textit{upqueries} as a mechanism for implementing
    partially stateful materialization in Noria, a materialized view system
    built using dataflow.

  \vspace{0.5\baselineskip}

  Experimental results suggest that the presented system increases supported
    application load by up to $20\times$ over MySQL, and reduces memory use by
    up to $\sfrac{2}{3}$ compared to existing approaches.
