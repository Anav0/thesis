There are two reasons why the results for a query may not be known: either the
query as a whole has not been seen before and must be incorporated, or the
results for the application's particular parameter values are missing from the
materialized view. This can occur either because that particular set of
parameter values have never been requested before, or because those results have
since been evicted. In either case, Noria must execute an upquery before it can
respond to the application's request.
