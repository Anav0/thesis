\begin{itemize}
 \item SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table;
 \item Add ``karma'' query:
   \begin{itemize}
    \item If already have ``karma'' column, trivial in DB. But, equivalent in
      Noria to saying that query was there from the start, so no migration.
    \item If \textbf{not} already have ``karma'' column, DB has two choices:
     \begin{enumerate}
      \item Compute column == expensive, and same as Noria would do
      \item Make query compute value on-demand -- same cost, but repeated!
     \end{enumerate}
   \end{itemize}
 \item TopK
\end{itemize}
