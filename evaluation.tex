The work in this thesis is built on the belief that materialization is useful,
and that partial materialization is necessary to make it practical for an
important class of applications. Without materialization, queries must either be
manually cached, which is labor-intensive and error-prone, or be computed on
demand, which is slow. And with full state materialization, all queries are
fast, but the memory cost is prohibitive for any but the smallest applications.
Whereas partial state allows you to trade off application tail latency for
reduced memory use.

In this section, I provide experimental and qualitative evidence that this
belief is warranted through analysis of the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item What impact does partial state have on memory use? \S\ref{s:eval:mem}
 \item What is the cost of using partial state? \S\ref{s:eval:cost}
 \item How dependent is partial state on application access patterns? \S\ref{s:eval:patterns}
 \item How does partial state compare to existing solutions? \S\ref{s:eval:existing}
\end{enumerate}

The high-level take-away from this section is that partial state allows
read-heavy applications with skewed access patterns to operate using
significantly less memory, with marginal impact on system throughput and
latency.

\section{What impact does partial state have on memory use?}
\label{s:eval:mem}

The primary motivation behind reducing application memory use is to reduce cost.
Higher memory use requires more memory, and more memory costs more, both in
purchasing and in ongoing power consumption. An application that uses less
memory can scale further on the same hardware, or, conversely, can run on
smaller hardware than would otherwise be needed.

The key question for partially stateful dataflow then is whether it truly and
meaningfully reduces application memory use. Or, more accurately, whether
applications can run efficiently when only some of its query results are cached.
Intuitively, one might expect this to be true for many user-driven applications:
some queries may only be executed for rarely used features, and unpopular posts
may be accessed only very infrequently, or perhaps not at all, after they were
initially posted.

To validate this, I used production statistics from the open-source Lobsters
news aggregator~\cite{lobsters,lobsters-data} to build a benchmarking harness
that approximates the page access patterns the real Lobsters website sees. The
load generator is ``partially open-loop'' to ensure that clients maintain the
measurement frequency even during periods of high latency, and also measure
queueing time~\cite{frank-open-loop,open-loop-cautionary-tale}. Since Lobsters
is a small site, relatively speaking, the harness also lets me to proportionally
scale up the access frequency to evaluate a larger deployment with the same
data and query access patterns.

I then wrote a Noria implementation for each Lobsters page endpoint that
queries the same data, and performs the same writes as the real Ruby-on-Rails
application.%
\footnote{I opted to do this rather than run the Ruby-on-Rails code directly to
avoid measuring Ruby and Rails bottlenecks.}
Together, these allow me to measure the throughput, latency, and memory overhead
that Noria would provide if used as the backend for Lobsters as it scales up.

Figure~\ref{f:lobsters-memory} shows the memory use with and without partial
materialization at a scale-up factor of 4000%
\footnote{When Noria runs without partial, this is the highest factor that still
fits in the 128GB of memory of the host machine.} times normal Lobsters load. It
also shows the lowest memory limit Noria can sustain without when eviction is
enabled. I run Noria with a progressively more aggressive eviction policy, and
stop once the 95th percentile exceeds XXXms.

This experiment exposes one of the fundamental trade-offs when using partial
state: memory use versus tail latency. The more memory you provide the partial
system with, the more of your tail will be pre-computed, and the more of your
requests will be fast. Conversely, you can use less memory if you are willing
for more of your tail to be computed on demand.

Figure~\ref{f:lobsters-mem-latency} explores this trade-off in more detail; as
the memory limit shrinks, the fraction of requests in the tail that must be
computed increases, and thus tail latency increases.

\section{What is the cost of using partial state?}
\label{s:eval:cost}

% NOTE: _could_ also talk about the cost of _materialization_ here (moving work
% to the write side), but that seems orthogonal?

Partial state's main drawback compared to traditional materialized views is
that the results for an application's query may not be known. When this happens,
the system must upquery the missing state, which takes time and consumes
resources otherwise dedicated to writes.

\subsection{Upqueries}

There are two reasons why the results for a query may not be known: either the
query as a whole has not been seen before and must be incorporated
(\S\ref{s:eval:cost:mig}), or the results for the application's particular
parameter values are missing from the materialized view. This can occur either
because that particular set of parameter values have never been requested
before, or because those results have since been evicted. In either case, Noria
must execute an upquery before it can respond to the application's request.

  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{example-image-golden}
  \caption{Lobsters latency cdf [ops] in steady-state at some memlimit.}
  \label{f:lobsters-latency-steady}
\end{figure}

\begin{inprogress}
Figure~\ref{f:lobsters-latency-steady} shows upqueries in tail, which is much
slower than main body of requests. Order of magnitude? More? Also show vote?
\end{inprogress}

  \label{f:lobsters-throughput-latency-steady-full-partial}
\end{figure}

\begin{inprogress}
Figure~\ref{f:lobsters-throughput-latency-steady-full-partial} shows that
partial has a higher tail latency because some miss. Same median (?).
\end{inprogress}

\begin{inprogress}
Maybe good place to have comparison with Redis?
Fig.: throughput vs latency w/wo partial in vote?
Note that the reason vote falls over when it does is single-core write
processing (since only one query, so one data-flow path).
\end{inprogress}

\subsection{Migrations}
\label{s:eval:cost:mig}

When the application issues a query that Noria has never seen before, Noria must
instantiate the dataflow for that query, along with any materializations it
might need.

Partial state also enables efficient migrations in many cases. Any view
that can be made partial (ref section + later eval) is immediately
available, and does not compute until requested.

Fig.: vote-migration skewed partial vs full

Upqueries are particularly frequent immediately after a new view is added, since
it starts out entirely empty.

\begin{inprogress}
Maybe show vote uniform numbers? Talk about ``warmup''?
\end{inprogress}

\section{How dependent is partial state on application access patterns?}
\label{s:eval:patterns}

Partial state is mainly useful if accesses are skewed towards particular queries
and particular data. When this is the case, caching a small number of the
application's computed state speeds up a significant fraction of requests. If
this is not the case, the likelihood of missing in the cache is inversely
proportional to the size of the cache, and you would need to cache most of the
data to have a decent cache hit rate.

\begin{inprogress}
The memory use for partial with and without eviction from earlier suggest that
this skew is indeed present in normal applications. As do other papers on the
subject (ref such papers).
\end{inprogress}

\begin{inprogress}
Note that eviction is necessary because, over time, more and more of the
tail will be sampled. Without eviction, eventually the entire tail would
be kept in memory (so == full).
\end{inprogress}

Deciding what memory limit to set is challenging, in part because it
may change over time as the access patterns change, and in part because
it depends on load. The higher the load, the more requests will be in
the tail (and miss). Of course, more requests will be in the head too.

Fig.: throughput vs 95\%-ile latency [memlimits] in vote.

For example, for Zipf distribution, we can compute \%s:

Tab.: | load | skew | keys hit in 30s | keys hit by 99\% | 

This is (again) why eviction is important â€” without it, partial would approach
full.

Lobsters suggests that significant skew is common. Also ref other
studies on log-normal/zipf/skew.

\subsection{When can partial state be used?}

\begin{itemize}
 \item SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table;
 \item Add ``karma'' query:
   \begin{itemize}
    \item If already have ``karma'' column, trivial in DB. But, equivalent in
      Noria to saying that query was there from the start, so no migration.
    \item If \textbf{not} already have ``karma'' column, DB has two choices:
     \begin{enumerate}
      \item Compute column == expensive, and same as Noria would do
      \item Make query compute value on-demand -- same cost, but repeated!
     \end{enumerate}
   \end{itemize}
 \item TopK
\end{itemize}

\section{How does partial state compare to existing solutions?}
\label{s:eval:existing}

This is a difficult question to answer. High-performance solutions are
often developed specifically for a given application, and not available
as general-purpose tools (ref facebook memcache, need cites here).
And applying the general-purpose tools that \textbf{are} available (memcache,
redis) effectively, requires significant effort on the part of the
application authors (or the evaluators). To manually add caching support
to Lobsters' XX queries, including mitigation, thundering herd
mitigation, and incremental updates would be a massive undertaking.

In some sense, this alone is an argument for Noria's approach. Since the
database uses information it already possesses (in the form of
application queries) to automatically optimize accesses through
materialization, it is relatively easy to take advantage of the benefits
that Noria provides.

Nonetheless, to shed some light on the absolute performance that Noria
provides against a caching system, I include below a performance
comparison between Noria and Redis. To approximate how a carefully
planned and optimized application caching deployment might perform, it
runs a workload that is idealized for a caching system:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Every Redis access hits in cache, to emulate perfect thundering herd
   mitigation and invalidation-avoidance schemes.
 \item Nearly all accesses (99.9\%) are reads, since writes would be
   bottlenecked by the backing store.
 \item All accesses are for a single integer value, to emulate a system that has
   perfect cache coverage. Request access keys are chosen according to a Zipfian
    distribution with $\alpha = 1.08$ (moderate skew).
 \item Accesses are batched to reduce serialization cost and increase
   throughput. Specifically, reads are \texttt{MGET}s, and writes are pipelined
    \texttt{INCRBY}s.
\end{itemize}

This is not a realistic use of Redis, but it allows us to ``assume the best''
about the underlying caching strategy and system. The benchmark runs for four
minutes, and then samples latencies for another two minutes.

Fig.: throughput vs 95\%-ile latency [noria,redis]

Redis is single threaded, which necessarily limits its performance. If we assume
perfect sharding, Redis should be able to support 16 times the load on a 16-core
machine. We see that 16x Redis ~= Noria (??), which suggests that Noria is
competitive with manual caching schemes.

\begin{inprogress}
Why on earth is Noria (full) \textbf{so} much faster than Noria (partial)?!
\end{inprogress}
