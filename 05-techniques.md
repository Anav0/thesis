# Practical Partial State

This chapter describes how partial state is realized in the context of
Noria. I first outline the general process for setting up, issuing, and
executing upqueries. I then provide detailed, practical solutions to the
challenges presented in the previous chapter.

## Implementing Partial State in Noria

<!--
tagged paths
upquery responses only follow one path
-->

## Solutions

### Indexing Obligations

<!-- imposed upquery requirements/constraints -->

### Upqueries Across Unions

<!-- union buffering -->

### Upqueries Across Joins

<!-- join alternation -->

### Indirect Key Dependencies

<!-- join eviction -->

### Upqueries Across Shard Boundaries

<!-- union-like buffering, unishard (+ reset) -->
