\begin{enumerate}
 \item Why is materialization useful for real-world use-cases?
 \item In what ways are existing materialization techniques lacking?
 \item How does partial state improve the usefulness of materialization?
\end{enumerate}

Caching.
OSDI paper.
Caching is labor intensive + error prone (Facebook memcached paper).
DB view materialization (like DBToaster) ``all or nothing''.
Commercial DB view materialization limited and slow (ref OSDI paper).
By folding the cache into the database, database knows how to keep it up
to date\,---\,avoids having that logic threaded through the application.
Partial state (and caching in general) enables \textbf{selective} materialization.
Materialization is generally useful when reads are more common than
writes, since it shifts the computation from reads to writes.
But, without partial state, materialization is an ``off/on'' option —
either you materialize all the results for a query, or none [TODO: not
quite true — more subtlety here — depends what you mean by ``query''
(e.g., parameterized or not)].
